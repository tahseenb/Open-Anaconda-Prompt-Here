# Open Anaconda Prompt here

# Steps

* First find the folder where pwp.py is available. For me it was C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3
* Copy the cwp-modified.py in the same directory.
* Edit the add-anaconda.reg on Notepad, to enter proper directory. In my case, the directory was C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3. If your directory is different, replace 'C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3' part with yours. (It can be found under C:\Users\UserName folder as well)
* Double-click the add-anaconda.reg file to merge it with your system.
